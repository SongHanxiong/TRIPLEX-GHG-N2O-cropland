# TRIPLEX-GHG-N2O-cropland
TRIPLEX-GHG model is a process-based biogeochemical model which is designed to simulate major green-house gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) from terrestrial ecosystems from site to global scale. In addition, other essential environmental variables can also be estimated (e.g., vegetation growth, soil organic carbon storage). For the current version of the TRIPLEX-GHG, reasonable N2O flux from major cropland soil under varying agricultural practices could be provided on global scale. The model was written with FORTRAN (Formula Translation).
